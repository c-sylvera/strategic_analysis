# Basic Ideas and Examples
## Introduction and General Principles
### Econ 2160 - Strategic Analysis Chapter 1

---





# What is a Game of Strategy 

- There are many kinds of games 
  - Chance (e.g. one-armed bandit)
  - Skill (e.g. 100m sprint)
  - Strategy (e.g. chess) 
  
- Strategic thinking is about your interactions with others as they do similar thinking at the same time and about the same situation 
- So we can think of game theory as the analysis of interactive decision making

# Some Examples Of Strategic Games

---

# Run or Pass? 

- You're at the two-yard line

- Your Pro-Bowl RB is averaging 4 yards per carry  &amp; is famously difficult to tackle (and had gained 4 yds on the previous play)

- Your Pro-Bowl QB is having a good but inefficient game  

- You have one timeout and about thirty seconds 

- The elements systematically call for a run

---
  

# The GPA Rat Race  

- Your class is graded on a curve 
  - 40% of the students will receive As 
  - 40% of the students will receive Bs 
  
- Your class forms a coalition to not work too hard 

- You note that if you work a little bit harder you can substantially improve your GPA, so you study a little bit harder 

- Everyone else comes to the same conclusion and now everyone is working harder than they would like 

- This situation is a version of the *prisoners' dilemma*

# We Can't Take The Exam Because We Had A Flat Tire

- Two Vanderbilt students go to a party in Memphis a couple days before a final exam 

- They return late the next day and are unable to study for the exam 

- Instead of taking the exam they craft an excuse that they were stuck in Memphis because they caught a flat tire and had great difficulty finding assistance

- The professor accepts the excuse and administers the exam the following day  


---

- Question 1 is simple and worth 10%. Both students get full marks.  

- Question 2 asks "Which tire?" and is worth 90 percent. 

- If they guess randomly and independently, they have a 25% chance of being correct. 
  - They both have the same options: {Front Driver, Rear Driver, Front Passenger, Rear Passenger} 
  - This yield 16 outcomes, 4 where they pick the same tire? 
  - Can they improve upon this? 
  
- It may seem obvious that the most likely tire would be the front passenger, but it's important to consider what your co-conspirator believes and what your co-conspirator believes you believe and so on 
  - As a note 50% of people select the front driver's side tire 
  - Without more info, these games don't converge on a **focal point** 



---
# Why Are Professors So Mean 

- Most professors draw a hard line on makeup exams and tardy submissions  

- The reason for this is because it is difficult to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent excuses 

- The only option is to adopt a "no excuses" strategy, but they will need a **credible commitment device** in order for the students to take the threat seriously 
  - can lean on university policy  
  - can make an early announcement
  - can make early harsh examples

# Roommates And Families On The Brink  

- You share an apartment with someone where you mutually agree to share the expenses of communal necessities - dishwasher detergent, paper towels, beer, toilet paper, etc. 

- However, one of you incurs an additional cost by physically getting the goods. How is this resolved? 

- Perhaps you play the waiting game, until one of you breaks. 

- In the dynamic context, conditions can deteriorate to the point where you run out of something critical. i.e. each of you and your roommate is pushing the other to the *brink* of catastrophe. 
  - This strategy is called **brinksmanship**  

---
# The Dating Game 

Dating is a classic game of hidden information 

- You would like to amplify your good qualities while concealing the bad ones. Your date has a similar strategy. 
  - The goal for both is determine the **signal** from the **noise** 

- Each of you needs to determine actions that are both **credible** and **costly** (not always in the sense of money) .
  - It's easy to groom so may provide little information 
  - Flowers are cheap  
  - Habits are harder to fake &amp; are revealing 
  - Costly gifts can be a credible signal of commitment 

- Dating is a game of **uncertain** and **incomplete** information where you would like to induce someone to reveal credible information. You induce them through the use of **screening devices**

# Our Strategy For Studying Games Of Strategy 

- The previous slides show frequent situations that come up in everyday life where you might not have realized you were exercising strategic thinking. 

- Moving forward we're going to construct a *theory* of strategic action 

- At first it may seem abstract but at the end you will have a better understanding of *why* games have the outcomes they do and not just *how* 

- What's to come tomorrow? *How to Think about Strategic Games*
